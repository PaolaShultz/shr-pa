# Continuous integration

[The CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) owns the existing offline checks.

## Failure and recovery notifications

[CI alerts](../.github/workflows/ci-alerts.yml) opens one GitHub issue when CI
fails on the current `main` commit, mentions `PaolaShultz`, and keeps repeated
failures in that thread. A passing run for the current commit posts **Recovered**,
renames and closes the issue. Ordinary successes and already-fixed historical
failures create no alerts. Cancelled or pending runs never count as recovery.

Email delivery follows GitHub's participating/@mention notification settings.
Native Actions emails remain a separate account preference; disabling those
avoids duplicate failure messages while retaining the incident thread.
The notifier uses a pinned shared action with `actions: read`, `contents: read`
and `issues: write`; it never runs the triggering code or accesses hardware.
See the [shared notification contract](https://github.com/PaolaShultz/gigpies/blob/main/docs/CI_ALERTS.md)
for retry behavior, tests and manual reconciliation. Existing CI checks are unchanged.
